Web app for Hi.rd - Hack @ Hophacks

<h5>Inspiration</h5>
What it does
streamlines the process for recruiters and applicants at hackathons and job fairs to give you one tool to keep open with a quick way to share your email and a small template message too with the resume attached!


<h5>For students</h5>
It let's you simply tap your phone against the table of any recruiter you're interested in, no emails, no cards, and you get an email back for you to reach out to for more information later on!


<h5>For recruiters</h5>
It uses NFC for bulk collection of resumes by letting potential applicants tap their phones against the your devices, it gives you contact emails and gives you their resumes so you can contact them after going through your applicant pool.
